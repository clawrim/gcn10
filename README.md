# GCN10
Global 10m Curve Number Dataset Repository

Welcome to the Global Curve Number Dataset Repository! This repository contains the code and resources for generating a high-resolution, open-source global curve number dataset designed to improve runoff estimation and hydrological modeling worldwide.
Overview

The dataset addresses limitations in existing curve number datasets (e.g., GCN250m, CUSCN30) by providing:

    High resolution for regional studies.
    Global coverage for underrepresented and remote regions.
    Compatibility with various hydrological models and GIS platforms.

The dataset includes 18 global raster maps tailored to distinct land covers, soil properties, and hydrological conditions. It is designed to support research, policy-making, and water resource management by offering scalable and consistent integration into hydrological models.
Features

    Global high-resolution curve number dataset
    Open-source and GIS-agnostic
    Applicable to diverse climatic regions, land uses, and soil types
