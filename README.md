Global 10m Curve Number Dataset Repository

Welcome to the Global Curve Number Dataset Repository! This repository contains the code and resources for generating a high-resolution, open-source global curve number dataset designed to improve runoff estimation and hydrological modeling worldwide.
Overview

The dataset includes 18 global raster maps tailored to distinct land covers, soil properties, and hydrological conditions. It is designed to support research, policy-making, and water resource management by offering scalable and consistent integration into hydrological models.
Features

1. Global high-resolution curve number dataset
2. Open-source and GIS-agnostic
3. Applicable to diverse climatic regions, land uses, and soil types
4. Tailored to hydrological scenarios for improved runoff estimation

Repository Contents
1. Code: Scripts for dataset generation and validation
2. Documentation: Instructions for using and integrating the dataset
3. Dataset Previews: Sample files and metadata
4. Validation: Results from performance testing across hydrological scenarios

Getting Started
